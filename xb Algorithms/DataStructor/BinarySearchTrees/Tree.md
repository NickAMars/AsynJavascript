Edge - connection between one node and another.

Algorithm    Average    Worst case
Space         O(n)          O(n)
Search        O(log n)      O(n)
Insert        O(log n)      O(n)
Delete        O(log n)      O(n)

e.g of a tree

      |         |   |       |

//BFS (search horizonal from left to right)
//DFS (search downward from top to bottom)
