//Binary Heap

MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes.
MinNinaryHeap , parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes.

A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first.

Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues
which are very commonly used data structures.

use with graph traversal algorithms
