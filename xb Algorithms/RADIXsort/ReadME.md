Radix sort is a special sorting algorithm that works on lists of numbers
It never makes comparison between elements!.

It explots the fact that information about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits

d - digit length and n - array length
Time complexity
O(nk)
Space complexity
O(d + n)
